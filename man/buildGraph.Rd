  regulon,
  mode = c("tripartite", "tg", "re", "pairs"),
  weights = "corr",
  aggregation_function = mean
)

rankTfs(graph, type_attr = "type")
}
\arguments{
\item{regulon}{an object returned by the getRegulon or addWeights function}

\item{mode}{a character specifying whch type of graph will be built. In \code{'tg'} mode
a bipartite graph is built connecting transcription factors directly to the target genes
and ignoring information about mediating regulatory elements; in \code{'pairs'} mode
transcription factors are connected to unique target gene-regulatory element pairs;
in \code{'tripartite'} mode the network is build of three type of vertices (nodes):
trascription factors, regulatory elements and target genes; here the path from
target gene to regulatory element always contains a regulatory element; in
\code{'re'} mode data in the target genes is dropped and only connections are
between transcription factors and regulatory elements.}

\item{weights}{a character specifying which variable should be used to assign
weights to edges. If set to 'NULL' then unweighted graph is built.}

\item{aggregation_function}{a function used to collapse duplicated edges}

\item{weighted}{a logical indicating whether weighted graphs are used}

\item{abs_diff}{a logical indicating whether absulute difference in the number
edges or their weights will be calculated}

\item{graph, graph_obj_1, graph_obj_2}{an igraph object}

\item{FUN}{a function used for normalization. The input to this
function is be the number of edges connected with each node (incident edges).}

\item{type_attr}{a character corresponding to the name of the vertex attribute
which indicate the type of vertex}
}
\value{
an igraph object
\code{rankTfs} returns a data.frame with transcription factors sorted according
to the value of the \code{centrality} attribute
}
\description{
\code{buildGraph} function creates a directed graph based on the output of
the \code{getRegulon} function.

\code{buildDiffGraph} a graph difference by subtracting the edges of \code{graph_obj_2}
from those of the \code{graph_obj_1}. If \code{weighted} is set to \code{TRUE} then for each
ordered pair of vertices (nodes) the difference in number of edges between \code{graph_obj_1}
and \code{graph_obj_1} is calculated. The result is used to set the number of
corresponding edges in output graph. Note that unless \code{abs_diff} is set to
\code{TRUE} any non-positive difference will translate into lack of the edges
for a corresponding ordered pair of vertices in the output graph (equivalent
to 0 value in the respective position in adjacency matrix). In case of
weighted graphs, the weight of the output graph is calculated as a difference
of the corresponding weights between input graphs.

\code{addCentrality} calculates degree centrality for each vertex using
\code{igraph::strength}.

With \code{normalizeCentrality} function the normalized values of centrality
are calculated from the original ones divided by
\code{FUN}(total number of non-zero edges associated with each node).

\code{rankTfs} assign ranks to transcription factors according to degree
centrality of their vertices
