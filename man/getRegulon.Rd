\title{A function to combine the TF binding motif info and peak to gene correlations to generate regulons}
\usage{
getRegulon(p2g, overlap, aggregate = TRUE)
}
\arguments{
\item{p2g}{A Peak2Gene dataframe created by ArchR or getP2Glinks() function}

\item{overlap}{A dataframe storing overlaps between the regions of the peak matrix with the bulk TF ChIP-seq binding sites computed from addTFMotifInfo}

\item{aggregate}{A Boolean value that specifies whether peak and gene ids are kept in regulon output or not}
}
\value{
A tall format dataframe consisting of tf(regulator), target and a column indicating degree of association between TF and target such as "mor" or "corr".
example regulon:
tf      target  corr
}
